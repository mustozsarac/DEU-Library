# DEU-Library
It's a solution to a synchronization problem.

On exam days at the DEU, you are waiting for a long time at the entrance of the working rooms in the library. We are launching the DEU Library application to facilitate this. This will prevent both all students to create long queues and to lock the working rooms before be full. Also it will provide an efficient and fair sharing because rooms will contain students up to its capacity.

My solution is with mutex and semaphores, and students hopefully will no longer wait so long for working.
